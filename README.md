This SQL code establishes a structured database for managing student, parent, teacher, class, and subject information. 
Each table has relationships defined through foreign keys, enabling efficient data organization and retrieval. 
The use of IF NOT EXISTS ensures that the code can be run multiple times without causing errors, making it useful for setting up or resetting the database structure.
